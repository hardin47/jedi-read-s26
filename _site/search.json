The desire and interest for JEDI resources was apparent, so a group of us set out to create a central location where statistics educators could find JEDI materials for teaching and professional growth. Using the JEDI resources, we have the opportunity to evolve and adapt statistics education and practices to suit the needs of our ever-changing world and students."

    "text": "JEDI + CAUSE\nArising from a strategic initiative of the American Statistical Association, the Consortium for the Advancement of Undergraduate Statistics Education (CAUSE) is a national organization whose mission is to support and advance undergraduate statistics education in four target areas: resources, professional development, outreach, and research. Also an initiative of the American Statistical Association, the Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) Outreach Group is a community of statisticians and data scientists committed to communication, programming, and professional development to advance and support a society that values all people. Pairing the two groups brings together teaching thoughtfulness under an inclusive lens."

    "text": "Website\nThe JEDI-CAUSE website has now become a valuable set of resources related to justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion to be used inside and outside the classroom. Acknowledging that the classroom is a space where humanity and education intersect, we think of our students first as people. In that light, the team has compiled examples, activities, and references to help instructors in varied environments teach in a way that is equitable, inclusive, and responsive to diverse student needs. Additionally, some of the website entries are designed to support teachers engaged in JEDI work as they navigate their professional trajectory beyond the classroom. As educators, we understand that time is limited; we’ve collected resources that we ourselves have found useful and that we want to share with other instructors."

The reading group participants will complete readings and discuss topics related to Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI). Each participant will create teaching materials for statistics and data science through six intensive two-hour collaborative meetings in the Spring of 2026. Members will post their created materials (e.g., activities, cleaned data, professional development materials, or more) on the existing JEDI-CAUSE website and on the QUBES platform to expand the availability and awareness of JEDI-related teaching materials for statistics and data science educators."

    "text": "Tips\nMeeting topics and general structure: Each meeting will include some time to work individually and/or together on new JEDI teaching materials. The first four meetings will also include discussions of readings.\n\nMeeting 1: Introductions, reading discussion (What does JEDI look like? Conceptual foundations), work time (start developing new JEDI teaching materials)\nMeeting 2: Reading discussion (Why JEDI? Present and Current Examples), sharing ideas in groups, work time\nMeeting 3: Reading discussion (How do we integrate JEDI into our teaching?), work time\nMeeting 4: Reading discussion (What if JEDI goes wrong?), work time\nMeeting 5: Peer review time, work time, group discussion\nMeeting 6: Presentations of completed work, submit materials to JEDI-CAUSE database\n\n\nPreparation for the first meeting:\nPlease read at least two of the three readings listed above. Below, we share some tips and questions to guide your reading.\nTips: There is no expectation that you read the texts linearly from start to finish. You are welcome to read them however you like and however time permits, of course, but in the interest of balancing your other priorities with the readings, we suggest that our priority should be engaging meaningfully with the heart of the texts rather than necessarily reading them start to finish. In this spirit, we recommend that you start by reading the headings, abstract (if there is one) and conclusion to get a sense for the overall scope and focus of the piece and anticipate what the reading might cover. Identify a few questions you hope to answer by reading the text, which may include questions below and your own. Then read the topic sentences of the paragraphs to get a sense for the structure and content of the text, and read the paragraphs that seem most relevant or of most interest to you. As time permits, once you feel you can summarize the key points of the reading and engage with the questions you posed, read as much of the remaining texts as you like.\n\n\nGuided reading questions:\n\nHow does each of the readings frame justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI)? What aspects of JEDI do the readings discuss?\nHow does each of the readings relate to implementing JEDI in the classroom? What aspects of the classroom (content, dynamics, format, policies, or other aspects) might be impacted by the ideas in the reading? In what types of courses could you most envision implementing the principles or ideas you gathered from these readings? Are there ways you can see applying these readings to your classroom, and how/why/why not?\nWhat questions do these readings raise in your mind?"
